    <string name="news_a">President Joe Biden has laid out plans to vaccinate 70% of US adults by 4 July and roll out the shots for 12- to 15-year-olds as soon as possible. Mr Bidens new goal includes having 160 million adults fully vaccinated by Independence Day. The target is well within reach as 105 million have already had the required jabs, and the US is vaccinating nearly a million adults per day. But the vaccination rate is half of what it was just three weeks ago. Mr Biden said his administration was working to win over "doubters" about the shots. Israel - a world leader in vaccination rates - has nearly fully reopened its economy and seen its number of new coronavirus cases crash to almost zero, with just over 60% of the population having received at least one shot. Israel may be close to herd immunity to Covid Herd immunity happens when enough of a population has protection against an infection that it stops being able to spread - and even people who don\'t themselves have immunity are indirectly protected. For Covid the estimated threshold for herd immunity is at least 65%-70% of people having protection against infection, although Mr Biden\'s chief medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci has increased his estimate to 90% and the World Health Organization (WHO) has said the level is not known. </string>
